# Standby
Measure and display CPU load, activate standby mode if appropriate.

This program measures and displays CPU load (all cores at once) using an LCD number. User can specify a CPU threshold and a countdown timer. With these data the program sends the PC into sleep mode if the CPU load threshold does not constantly met during the countdown. Any keystroke or mouse movement (in the program's window) resets the timer. So as CPU load exceeding the threshold.

It can be very useful if Windows automatically wakes up in the middle of the night. :)
